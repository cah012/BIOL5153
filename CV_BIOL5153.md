Professional Profile
Highly motivated and driven researcher with excellent interpersonal skills and a proven record of accomplishing scientific goals related to cloning, DNA isolation and purification, and analysis of nutrient-variant growth studies.

With almost four years of research experience in a microbiology laboratory setting, I am accustomed to being part of a team whose overarching scientific goals involve the discovery of fundamental physiological functions in microbes, specifically certain methanogens and E. coli. I have extensive experience making different kinds of media and reagents, performing all aspects of cloning, and using pipettes, centrifuges, spectrophotometers and other standard molecular biology laboratory devices. I also possess strong planning and organizational skills which contribute to the effective acquisition and analysis of data.

Career Summary 
Jan 2017 - Present 		University of Arkansas, Microbial Physiology and Genetics Laboratory
				Technical Assistant 
Outline of role
Worked directly under the supervision of a principal investigator to perform numerous lab procedures related to PCR, cloning, and the effects of varying sulfur and nitrogen conditions on cellular growth; I carried out all related experiments and ensured that each procedure was conducted in a precise, organized, and consistent manner.

Key Responsibilities
"	Performed every aspect of standard bacterial cloning, including PCR, DNA purification, plasmid preparations, restriction enzyme digests, ligations, transformations, and inoculations
"	Designed and performed growth studies to assess the effects of nutrient-variant conditions on multiple strains of methanogen M. acetivorans
"	Monitored cellular growth via optical density using a spectrophotometer 
"	Produced various kinds of media, including LB and high-salt media for methanogens; high-salt media was made in an anaerobic glove bag
"	Regularly manipulated the presence of different kinds of nutrients within media solutions, which always required sterile technique and was performed either using pipettes (plastic and serological tips) or syringes and needles (for the sealed, anaerobic solutions)
"	Analyzed the presence of specific DNA fragments via gel electrophoresis
"	Carried out routine lab maintenance that included washing glassware, restocking common lab supplies, and autoclaving 
"	Entered raw data into excel spreadsheets and summarized data in the form of graphs, figures, and written form in word documents
"	Used sterile technique to ensure reagents, media, and cell cultures were not contaminated 

Key Achievement/Projects
"	Worked to characterize the role of nitrogenase in M. acetivorans by performing over 15 small and large scale growth studies (all of which lasted several weeks), each testing the effects of different nitrogen and sulfur nutrient conditions on cellular growth; small scale studies included 8-24 replicates and large scale studies often had over 90 replicates

Aug 2013 - Dec 2016 		University of Arkansas, Microbial Physiology and Genetics Laboratory
				Undergraduate Intern
Outline of role
Worked under a lab manager and with graduate students to perform basic molecular biology procedures; general tasks emphasized cloning and DNA product analysis was conducted via gel electrophoresis and genetic sequencing

Key Responsibilities
"	Performed standard bacterial cloning procedures to produce strains of E. coli containing genetically altered plasmids
"	Induced protein expression in E. coli to generate and isolate proteins of interest 
"	Analyzed DNA products by gel electrophoresis, often adjusting the density of the agarose gels based on the size of the predicted products
"	Maintained a detailed lab notebook that explained various lab procedures and the rationale behind them; pages included details of PCRs, digests, transformations, and pictures of gels with DNA products in them

Key Achievement/Projects
"	Developed a mutant strain of M. acetivorans with a specific gene deletion by applying principles of DNA recombination; this strain was used in numerous growth studies to assess the effect of the deletion of a potentially critical iron-sulfur cluster carrier protein 
"	Data generated from subjecting this mutant strain to nutrient-variant growth studies was used in Department of Energy grant proposals

Aug 2016 - Dec 2016 		University of Arkansas, Plant Science and Biotechnology Laboratory
				Undergraduate Intern
Outline of role
Worked with and reported to graduate students as we subjected various strains of Arabidopsis plants to heat-induced protein expression; I helped plate seeds, make media and agar plates, and compile data. 

Jul 2016 - Aug 2016 		University of Arkansas, Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve - Thailand
				Independent Ecological Researcher
Outline of role
Studied abroad in Thailand and surveyed the Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve in order to record population densities of herpetofauna and endangered nocturnal primate Nycticebus bengalensis. I was also part of a team that conducted a large scale study analyzing the effects of venomous snake mimicry on predation.


Scholarships & Honors
"	Silas Hunt Distinguished Scholarship - $5000 per year (Fall 2012 - Spring 2015)
"	University of Arkansas Honors College (Fall 2012 - Fall 2015)
"	Awarded a $600 Study Abroad travel grant (Summer 2016)
